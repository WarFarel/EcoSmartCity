This project will be about making a simulator to model and optimise different aspects of the futuristic, environmentally-friendly city. It will help the city planners and policymakers to make informed decisions about the different urban sustainability developement.
The specifics are to mkae a module for the simulation that manages and optimises the city's renawable energy energy distribution system. I made this as much user-friendlyy as well as efficient as I could have from my abilities.
