-------------------
# This project will be about making a simulator to model and optimise different aspects of the futuristic, environmentally-friendly city. It will help the city planners and policymakers to make informed decisions about the different urban sustainability developement.
# The specifics are to mkae a module for the simulation that manages and optimises the city's renawable energy energy distribution system. I made this as much user-friendlyy as well as efficient as I could have from my abilities.

# Algorithm
----------
# The algorithm will have different types of the energy sources, those will be the hydro energy production, solar power and wind as well as geothermal. They will have different maximum energy that they can produce. This will be in kW as this is more widely used scale.
# It will have a status which will either indicate that it is active or inactive when the source of this will be turned off,  this will help to defuse any confusion, another aspect will be the effectiveness of the energy being convered from the inputs to the outputs.
# After that the demand which will be able to be compared with the current production levels will be available. The algorith will also help to optimise the energy that will be distribiuted in order to meet the demand,efficient and availability.
# After all of this is done there will be statistics available to have things such as Total energy produced, total energy consumption and remaining energy surplus.
